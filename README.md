# analyticsServer

##how to use
When downloading, the AnalyticServer folder has all material used to create restful spring server, which I built in eclipse
All other files and folders belong to the web pages I created, which I created in NetBeans
In the web folder you can two other folders, tag and dashboard
The tag folder has two demo html pages with the script tag, and the tag.js has the code for the script tag
The dashboard folder has the html, JavaScript, and css files I used to create the dashboard
When entering dates for the dashboard enter in format dd-mm-yyyy.
These dates are transformed to timestamps starting at the date plus 00:00:00 (so the very beginning of the day)
So to track you can only track in days
For example, to see request made on March 24,2020 the start date would be 24-03-2020 and the end date would have to be 25-03-2020
